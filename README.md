BACKEND CONTENTS 

This Flask-based backend service provides a simple interface to interact with an external AI model. It features a health check endpoint (/) that confirms the server is running, and a chat endpoint (/api/chat) that accepts user messages via POST requests, sends them to an AI service, and returns the AI's response. The service also serves static frontend files from a specified directory, allowing integration with a web interface. To use the service, you need to set up environment variables for the AI API URL (AI_API_URL) and model name (AI_MODEL_NAME). The backend is built using Python 3, Flask, Flask-CORS, and the requests library for making API calls to the AI service. The server can be run in development mode locally, and it listens on http://localhost:5000 by default, accessible from any IP address. If the AI service is not reachable or the user input is invalid, the API returns appropriate error messages. To set up, install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, configure the environment variables, and ensure the frontend files are located in a frontend directory one level above the project directory.
